He played high school hockey at the Athol Murray College of Notre Dame (a boarding school) in Wilcox, Saskatchewan under coach Barry MacKenzie. In Pellerin's junior year, his midget AAA hockey team took 2nd place in the 1987 Air Canada Cup (the national midget AAA finals). His high school hockey teammates included other future NHLers including Rod Brind'Amour, Jeff Batters, Jason Herter and Joby Messier.  In 1988, Pellerin's senior year, he played for the Hounds junior AA team during its 1st season in the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League.  That year, the Hounds won the Centennial Cup (the National Junior AA championship) behind goaltender Curtis Joseph.\\nPellerin was drafted 47th overall by the New Jersey Devils in the 1989 NHL Entry Draft.  He won the Hobey Baker Award as the best collegiate player in America in 1992 while playing for the University of Maine.  He turned pro in 1992, joined the Devils organization and divided his time between the NHL and the AHL  with the Utica Devils and then the Albany River Rats.  Pellerin signed with the St. Louis Blues in 1996, where he played more ice time.  His best season in the NHL came with the Blues in 1998\\u201399 where in 80 games, he scored 20 goals and 41 points.\\nIn 2000, Pellerin was claimed by the Minnesota Wild in the 2000 NHL Expansion Draft but was traded to the Carolina Hurricanes for the rights of Askhat Rakhmatulin and two draft picks at the trade deadline.  He signed with the Boston Bruins in 2001 but after just one goal in 35 games, he was placed on waivers and eventually claimed by the Dallas Stars. In 2003, he was traded to the Phoenix Coyotes for Claude Lemieux and the rights to Guy Lanouette.  Pellerin re-signed with St. Louis, but only managed two games for the team having been assigned to the AHL's Worcester IceCats. He retired in 2004. In total, Pellerin played 536 regular season games in the NHL, scoring 72 goals and 126 assists for 198 points.\\nSince 2015, Pellerin has served as the director of player development for the Toronto Maple Leafs of the NHL.  He was promoted to Senior Director of Player Development on August 23, 2018, with Stephane Robidas promoted to take his place.  Pellerin was announced as an NHL scout with the Arizona Coyotes in September 2021. \\nIn 1997, Pellerin was inducted into the University of Maine Hall of Fame and in 2008 he was inducted into the New Brunswick Sports Hall of Fame.\\n\\nAwards and honors\\nCareer statistics\\nRegular season and playoffs\\nInternational\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nBiographical information and career statistics from NHL.com, or Eliteprospects.com, or Hockey-Reference.com, or The Internet Hockey Database\",\n          \"Richard Nash (born June 16, 1984) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player who serves as the director of player development for the Columbus Blue Jackets of the National Hockey League (NHL). After being selected first overall in the 2002 NHL Entry Draft by Columbus, he played 15 seasons in the NHL for the Blue Jackets, New York Rangers and Boston Bruins, and was selected to play in six National Hockey League All-Star Games.\\nPrior to turning professional, Nash was a highly regarded prospect with the London Knights of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) where he spent two seasons, earning the Emms Family Award in 2001 as the League's Rookie of the Year. He began his NHL career with the Blue Jackets immediately following his draft, in 2002\\u201303, and was nominated for the Calder Trophy as NHL Rookie of the Year. In his second NHL season, Nash scored 41 goals to tie with Jarome Iginla and Ilya Kovalchuk as winners of the Maurice \\\"Rocket\\\" Richard Trophy as the NHL's leading goal-scorer. Nash is a five-time NHL All-Star and was also awarded the NHL Foundation Player Award in the 2008\\u201309 season for his charitable work in the Columbus community. He is the all-time Blue Jackets franchise leader in goals, points, and games played. In 2022, Nash's number 61 was retired by the Blue Jackets.\\nInternationally, Nash has represented Team Canada, with whom he has won one gold and two silver medals at the World Championships, and two gold medals at the Winter Olympics in 2010 and 2014. Additionally, he has represented Canada at the 2002 World Junior Championships, helping the team to a silver medal, and also competed for Canada in the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin.\\n\\nBackground\\nNash was raised in Brampton, Ontario, where he attended Brampton Centennial Secondary School. He played minor hockey in the Greater Toronto Hockey League (GTHL), where he caught the attention of OHL scouts in 1999. He played in the 1998 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with the Toronto Marlboros minor ice hockey team.\\n\\nPlaying career\\nAs a member of the London Knights for two seasons in the OHL, Rick Nash began his major junior career with 66 points in his first year, receiving the Emms Family Award as the League's top rookie. The following season, he amassed 72 points in 54 games and was subsequently selected first overall in the 2002 NHL Entry Draft by the Columbus Blue Jackets.\\n\\nColumbus Blue Jackets (2002\\u20132012)\\nThe first NHL contract for Nash was negotiated minutes before the signing deadline by Gord Kirke. It was the most lucrative contract for an NHL rookie at the time, valued at 1.2 million USD per season plus bonuses and incentives which ranged from 8 to US$12 million.\\nJoining the Blue Jackets in 2002\\u201303, Nash debuted on October 10, 2002, and scored a goal in a 2\\u20131 win over the Chicago Blackhawks. He was the eighth number one overall pick to score a goal in his first game and the first to do so in his draft year since Mario Lemieux in 1984. That season, Nash was nominated for the Calder Trophy as the NHL's top rookie, but lost to defenseman Barret Jackman of the St. Louis Blues. He would, however, join Jackman on the NHL All-Rookie Team.\\nIn Nash's sophomore campaign, he improved his rookie goal total from 17 to 41, a career-high that tied Jarome Iginla and Ilya Kovalchuk for the Maurice \\\"Rocket\\\" Richard Trophy for most goals in the League. At 19 years of age, Nash was the youngest player in history to lead the League in goals. Recording 16 assists, Nash finished the year with 57 points.\\nDuring the 2004\\u201305 NHL lockout, Nash played for HC Davos of the Swiss Nationalliga A (NLA). He scored 26 goals and 46 points in 44 games and added 11 more points (nine goals and two assists) in 15 games in the NLA playoffs. Joined by fellow NHL-er Joe Thornton, Davos went on to win the Swiss Championship, as well as the 2004 Spengler Cup.\\n\\nWith the NHL set to resume play in 2005\\u201306, the Blue Jackets re-signed Nash to a five-year, $27 million contract. The deal saw his annual salary increase each year, with $3.5 million the first season and $7 million in the last season of the contract for a $5.4 million average salary. Knee and ankle injuries, however, sidelined Nash for much of the first half of the season. Missing 28 games total, Nash was still named to Team Canada for the 2006 Olympics, shortly after being activated from the injured reserve. Upon returning from a disappointing seventh-place finish in Turin, Nash completed the season at a point-per-game pace with 54 points in 54 games.\\nIn 2006\\u201307, Nash matched his sophomore points total with 57, and was named to the Western Conference All-Star Team for the second time in his career. He was Columbus' lone representative both times. Nash scored the game-winning goal in the West win.\\nThe following season, on January 17, 2008, Nash scored what many commentators called the \\\"goal of the year\\\" in the final minute versus the Phoenix Coyotes. Breaking a tied score, Nash deked around two defenders and the goaltender to score the eventual game-winner. Later, at the end of the season, the goal was nominated for an ESPY Award in the category of Best Play. Selected to his third All-Star Game in 2008 that season, Nash scored the quickest goal in All-Star Game history, just 12 seconds in and ended the game with a hat-trick.\\nCompleting the season with 38 goals and 69 points, Nash nearly matched his personal best goals total and set a career high for points and assists. Shortly before the end of the season, on March 12, 2008, Nash was also named the fifth captain in Blue Jackets history, replacing the recently traded Adam Foote.\\nIn the off-season, in May 2008, Nash was named the cover athlete and spokesman for the NHL 2K9 video game.\\n\\nGoing into the 2008\\u201309 campaign, the Blue Jackets had gone without a playoff appearance in franchise history. Led by the newly appointed captain Nash and bolstered by rookie goaltender Steve Mason, the Blue Jackets finished the season as the seventh seed in the Western Conference to earn a post-season berth against division-rival the Detroit Red Wings. The series was preceded by an 8\\u20132 rout over the Red Wings on March 7, 2009, a game in which Nash scored three unassisted goals. According to the Columbus Dispatch, citing the Elias Sports Bureau, the last player to score three goals unassisted was Maurice Richard (who scored four) against the New York Rangers at Madison Square Garden on March 14, 1948.  Despite the convincing victory late in the season, the Blue Jackets were swept by the Red Wings in four games.\\nIn addition to leading the Blue Jackets to the playoffs, Nash had a career season with 79 points, in addition to scoring 40 goals for the first time since 2003\\u201304. In the off-season, on July 3, 2009, Nash signed an eight-year contract extension with the Blue Jackets worth $62.4 million set to take effect in 2010\\u201311.\\nAs the 2011\\u201312 season began to unfold, Columbus recorded a dismal 2\\u201312\\u20131 record, the worst start to an NHL season by any team in 19 years. With the team struggling, rumors began circulating that the Blue Jackets were contemplating trading Nash as a solution to their on-ice woes. While Blue Jackets General Manager Scott Howson stated publicly that he had had no discussions regarding a Nash deal, other teams had indeed inquired about his availability. When asked about it, Nash stated that if the franchise felt it could improve itself by dealing him, he would be willing to waive his no-trade clause in order to get the deal done. Though Howson had previously maintained that he had no intention of trading Nash, two weeks before the trade deadline, he stated in the press that the team was open to all options and they were willing to listen to trade proposals for Nash, despite not actively shopping him. Speculation was that in return for Nash the Blue Jackets would ask for a top six forward, a top prospect and a first-round draft pick.\\nTrade speculation continued on into the summer with no deal imminent. While Howson claimed he merely wanted to receive \\\"market value\\\" in any deal for Nash, there was speculation that his asking price was too high for many rival NHL GMs to consider. Columbus eventually found a trade partner in the New York Rangers. Nash, along with Steven Delisle and a conditional third-round pick in the 2013 NHL Entry Draft, were traded to the Rangers for Artem Anisimov, Brandon Dubinsky, Tim Erixon and a 2013 first-round draft pick.\\n\\nNew York Rangers (2012\\u20132018)\\nNash signed a contract to play with HC Davos again during the 2012\\u201313 NHL lockout. In late September 2012, while playing for Davos, Nash injured his shoulder and left the game.\\n\\nNash had a successful first regular season with the Rangers, scoring 21 goals and 21 assists for 42 points in 44 games played in the lockout-shortened 2012\\u201313 season. However, in the playoffs, Nash underwhelmed with only one goal and four assists in 12 playoff games.\\nNash opened the 2013\\u201314 season well, with three assists in two games. But on October 8, 2013, in a game against the San Jose Sharks, Nash suffered a concussion from a hit by Brad Stuart, which forced him to miss 17 games. On November 21, Nash scored his first goal of the season in a 3\\u20132 win against the Dallas Stars. He would finish the season with a solid goal total of 26 in 65 games, but with only 13 assists, his 39 points tied a career low. Nash struggled mightily in the playoffs for the second straight year, scoring only three goals in 25 playoff games. Despite his low offensive production, however, he was solid defensively throughout, and the Rangers reached the Stanley Cup Finals, ultimately losing in five games to the Los Angeles Kings in a series in which all the games were close decisions.\\nNash had a superstar season in 2014\\u201315 scoring a career-high 42 goals (third in the NHL behind Steven Stamkos with 43 and Alexander Ovechkin with 53) and 27 assists. Nash's production also improved during the 2015 playoffs, as he scored five goals and nine assists (14 points) in 19 games as the Rangers fell to the Tampa Bay Lightning in a hard-fought seven-game Eastern Conference Finals series.\\nNash's performance declined at the start of the 2015\\u201316 season as he struggled to recapture his scoring pace from the previous season. This was further exacerbated by muscle spasms that caused Nash to miss 22 games. Despite being involved in trade rumors, few teams seemed to be interested in Rick Nash and his $7.9 million cap hit. Nash scored a career-low 15 goals, going with 21 assists for a career-low 36 points. He then recorded two goals and two assists in New York's five-game opening round loss to the Pittsburgh Penguins in the 2016 Stanley Cup playoffs.\\nOn October 11, 2016 Nash was named an alternate captain for the New York Rangers, joining Daniel Girardi, Marc Staal, and Derek Stepan along with captain Ryan McDonagh. On November 8, 2016, Nash scored his 400th goal in a 5\\u20133 loss against the Vancouver Canucks. Nash again missed several games during the 2016\\u201317 season, this time with a nagging groin injury. He still managed to score 23 goals and 15 assists for 38 points, in 67 games. Nash's production continued to improve during the 2017 Stanley Cup playoffs. He recorded two goals and one assist in the Rangers six-game opening-round victory over the Montreal Canadiens.\\nOn October 26, 2017, Nash skated in his 1,000th NHL career game, which resulted in a 5\\u20132 win over the Arizona Coyotes. He became the 312th player in NHL history to play at least 1,000 career games.\\n\\nBoston Bruins (2018)\\nDuring the 2017\\u201318 season, the Rangers struggled relative to their results from past seasons. On February 8, 2018, the team released a letter to fans that signaled intentions to begin a rebuild, to which rumors of a Nash trade began to swirl, as he was in the last year of his contract. On February 25, 2018, one day before the trade deadline, Nash was traded to the Boston Bruins in exchange for Ryan Spooner, Matt Beleskey, prospect Ryan Lindgren, a 2018 first-round pick (which became Jacob Bernard-Docker), and a 2019 seventh-round pick (which became Massimo Rizzo). Rick Nash's first goal as a Bruin, and his 800th career point, came on February 27, 2018, in a 4\\u20133 overtime Bruins home ice win over the Carolina Hurricanes. Nash would go on to play 23 games for the Bruins, and suffered a concussion in a game against the Tampa Bay Lightning, after a hit from Cedric Paquette.\\nOn January 11, 2019, at age 34, due to unresolved symptoms from a concussion sustained in March 2018, Nash was forced to retire from professional hockey after playing 1,060 career games spanning over 15 seasons.\\n\\nInternational play\\nIn Nash's second junior season, he was chosen to play for Team Canada's junior squad in the 2002 World Junior Championships, scoring three points in a silver medal effort.\\n\\nNash would make his senior international debut for Team Canada at the 2005 World Championship, leading the tournament in goals while earning his second silver medal.\\nIn 2006, shortly after returning from an injury, he was selected to play on Team Canada's Olympic team, but managed just one point in a disappointing seventh-place finish.\\nThe following year, Nash captured his first gold medal with Team Canada at the 2007 World Championship in a 4\\u20132 victory over Finland in Moscow. Scoring two goals in the gold medal game against Finland and 11 points total, Nash was named to the tournament All-Star Team and earned MVP honours.\\nNash appeared in his third World Championship in 2008, but failed to repeat as gold medal champion with Canada, earning silver. In the championship game against Russia, Nash attempted to clear the puck in overtime, but accidentally shot it over the glass, resulting a delay of game penalty. On the powerplay, Russia capitalized, defeating Canada 5\\u20134. Despite his misplay, Nash was named to the tournament All-Star Team for the second consecutive year, finishing with 13 points.\\nOn December 30, 2009, Nash was selected to play for Team Canada at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. After starting the tournament on Sidney Crosby's wing, he was switched to a line with Mike Richards and Jonathan Toews, who was named Best Forward. Nash earned his first Olympic medal in the tournament as Team Canada went on to win gold.\\nNash was named captain of Team Canada for the 2011 IIHF World Championship. Canada finished fifth in the tournament.\\nRick Nash won his second gold medal with Team Canada at the 2014 Winter Olympics.\\n\\nCareer statistics\\nRegular season and playoffs\\nInternational\\nAwards\\nOHL\\n\\nOHL All-Rookie Team \\u2013 2001\\nEmms Family Award (rookie of the year) \\u2013 2001\\nCHL\\n\\nCHL All-Rookie Team \\u2013 2001\\nNHL\\n\\nNHL All-Rookie Team \\u2013 2003\\nMaurice \\\"Rocket\\\" Richard Trophy \\u2013 2004 (shared with Ilya Kovalchuk and Jarome Iginla)\\nNHL All-Star Game appearance \\u2013 2004, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011, 2015\\nNHL Foundation Player Award \\u2013 2009\\n#61 retired by the Columbus Blue Jackets - 2022\\nNLA\\n\\nBest Swiss League forward \\u2013 2004\\u201305\\nInternational\\n\\nWorld Championships gold medal \\u2013 2007\\nWorld Championships MVP \\u2013 2007\\nWorld Championships All-Star Team \\u2013 2007, 2008\\nGold medal \\u2013 2010 Winter Olympic Games\\nGold medal \\u2013 2014 Winter Olympic Games\\nOther\\n\\nBest Play ESPY Award nomination \\u2013 2008\\n\\nSee also\\nList of Columbus Blue Jackets players\\nList of NHL players with 1,000 games played\\n\\nReferences\\nExternal links\\nBiographical information and career statistics from NHL.com, or Eliteprospects.com, or ESPN.com, or Eurohockey.com, or Hockey-Reference.com, or The Internet Hockey Database\\nRick Nash at Team Canada\\nRick Nash at Olympics.comRick Nash at Olympic.org (archived)\\nRick Nash at Olympedia \\nRick Nash at Olympics at Sports-Reference.com (archived)\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":29}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Clean Wikipedia Articles"],"metadata":{"id":"MlI6RrUZURY4"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["for index, row in people_df.iterrows():\n","  page = row['wiki page']\n","  people_df.at[index, 'clean page'] = (\n","    page\n","    .replace(\"\\n\",\" \")\n","    .replace(\"\\'s\",'')\n","    .replace('\\'','')\n","    .replace(\"(\", \"\")\n","    .replace(\")\", \"\")\n","    .replace('\"', \"\")\n","    .replace(',', \"\")\n","  )\n","\n","people_df"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"PydKVSc-UTZj","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1715729150835,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":147,"user":{"displayName":"Pranab Shenoy","userId":"09902948487938805603"}},"outputId":"8bbc174d-7255-4fb8-9c3e-9392c27691d2"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                            name                    wiki topic  \\\n","0                 Scott Pellerin                Scott_Pellerin   \n","1   Willie Mitchell (ice hockey)  Willie_Mitchell_(ice_hockey)   \n","2                     Guy Larose                    Guy_Larose   \n","3                   Todd Strueby                  Todd_Strueby   \n","4       Don Jackson (ice hockey)      Don_Jackson_(ice_hockey)   \n","5                 Chris McAlpine                Chris_McAlpine   \n","6                   Robyn Regehr                  Robyn_Regehr   \n","7                     Byron Bitz                    Byron_Bitz   \n","8                    Zach Parise                   Zach_Parise   \n","9                      Rick Nash                     Rick_Nash   \n","10                    Adam Oates                    Adam_Oates   \n","\n","                                            wiki page  \\\n","0   Scott Jaque-Frederick Pellerin (born January 9...   \n","1   William Mitchell (born April 23, 1977) is a Ca...   \n","2   Guy B.

He played high school hockey at the Athol Murray College of Notre Dame (a boarding school) in Wilcox, Saskatchewan under coach Barry MacKenzie. In Pellerin's junior year, his midget AAA hockey team took 2nd place in the 1987 Air Canada Cup (the national midget AAA finals). His high school hockey teammates included other future NHLers including Rod Brind'Amour, Jeff Batters, Jason Herter and Joby Messier.  In 1988, Pellerin's senior year, he played for the Hounds junior AA team during its 1st season in the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League.

After being selected first overall in the 2002 NHL Entry Draft by Columbus, he played 15 seasons in the NHL for the Blue Jackets, New York Rangers and Boston Bruins, and was selected to play in six National Hockey League All-Star Games.\\nPrior to turning professional, Nash was a highly regarded prospect with the London Knights of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) where he spent two seasons, earning the Emms Family Award in 2001 as the League's Rookie of the Year. He began his NHL career with the Blue Jackets immediately following his draft, in 2002\\u201303, and was nominated for the Calder Trophy as NHL Rookie of the Year. In his second NHL season, Nash scored 41 goals to tie with Jarome Iginla and Ilya Kovalchuk as winners of the Maurice \\\"Rocket\\\" Richard Trophy as the NHL's leading goal-scorer. Nash is a five-time NHL All-Star and was also awarded the NHL Foundation Player Award in the 2008\\u201309 season for his charitable work in the Columbus community. He is the all-time Blue Jackets franchise leader in goals, points, and games played. In 2022, Nash's number 61 was retired by the Blue Jackets.\\nInternationally, Nash has represented Team Canada, with whom he has won one gold and two silver medals at the World Championships, and two gold medals at the Winter Olympics in 2010 and 2014.

He was the eighth number one overall pick to score a goal in his first game and the first to do so in his draft year since Mario Lemieux in 1984. That season, Nash was nominated for the Calder Trophy as the NHL's top rookie, but lost to defenseman Barret Jackman of the St. Louis Blues. He would, however, join Jackman on the NHL All-Rookie Team.\\nIn Nash's sophomore campaign, he improved his rookie goal total from 17 to 41, a career-high that tied Jarome Iginla and Ilya Kovalchuk for the Maurice \\\"Rocket\\\" Richard Trophy for most goals in the League. At 19 years of age, Nash was the youngest player in history to lead the League in goals. Recording 16 assists, Nash finished the year with 57 points.\\nDuring the 2004\\u201305 NHL lockout, Nash played for HC Davos of the Swiss Nationalliga A (NLA).

Joined by fellow NHL-er Joe Thornton, Davos went on to win the Swiss Championship, as well as the 2004 Spengler Cup.\\n\\nWith the NHL set to resume play in 2005\\u201306, the Blue Jackets re-signed Nash to a five-year, $27 million contract. The deal saw his annual salary increase each year, with $3.5 million the first season and $7 million in the last season of the contract for a $5.4 million average salary. Knee and ankle injuries, however, sidelined Nash for much of the first half of the season. Missing 28 games total, Nash was still named to Team Canada for the 2006 Olympics, shortly after being activated from the injured reserve. Upon returning from a disappointing seventh-place finish in Turin, Nash completed the season at a point-per-game pace with 54 points in 54 games.\\nIn 2006\\u201307, Nash matched his sophomore points total with 57, and was named to the Western Conference All-Star Team for the second time in his career. He was Columbus' lone representative both times. Nash scored the game-winning goal in the West win.\\nThe following season, on January 17, 2008, Nash scored what many commentators called the \\\"goal of the year\\\" in the final minute versus the Phoenix Coyotes. Breaking a tied score, Nash deked around two defenders and the goaltender to score the eventual game-winner. Later, at the end of the season, the goal was nominated for an ESPY Award in the category of Best Play. Selected to his third All-Star Game in 2008 that season, Nash scored the quickest goal in All-Star Game history, just 12 seconds in and ended the game with a hat-trick.\\nCompleting the season with 38 goals and 69 points, Nash nearly matched his personal best goals total and set a career high for points and assists. Shortly before the end of the season, on March 12, 2008, Nash was also named the fifth captain in Blue Jackets history, replacing the recently traded Adam Foote.\\nIn the off-season, in May 2008, Nash was named the cover athlete and spokesman for the NHL 2K9 video game.\\n\\nGoing into the 2008\\u201309 campaign, the Blue Jackets had gone without a playoff appearance in franchise history. Led by the newly appointed captain Nash and bolstered by rookie goaltender Steve Mason, the Blue Jackets finished the season as the seventh seed in the Western Conference to earn a post-season berth against division-rival the Detroit Red Wings. The series was preceded by an 8\\u20132 rout over the Red Wings on March 7, 2009, a game in which Nash scored three unassisted goals. According to the Columbus Dispatch, citing the Elias Sports Bureau, the last player to score three goals unassisted was Maurice Richard (who scored four) against the New York Rangers at Madison Square Garden on March 14, 1948.  Despite the convincing victory late in the season, the Blue Jackets were swept by the Red Wings in four games.\\nIn addition to leading the Blue Jackets to the playoffs, Nash had a career season with 79 points, in addition to scoring 40 goals for the first time since 2003\\u201304.

With the team struggling, rumors began circulating that the Blue Jackets were contemplating trading Nash as a solution to their on-ice woes. While Blue Jackets General Manager Scott Howson stated publicly that he had had no discussions regarding a Nash deal, other teams had indeed inquired about his availability. When asked about it, Nash stated that if the franchise felt it could improve itself by dealing him, he would be willing to waive his no-trade clause in order to get the deal done. Though Howson had previously maintained that he had no intention of trading Nash, two weeks before the trade deadline, he stated in the press that the team was open to all options and they were willing to listen to trade proposals for Nash, despite not actively shopping him. Speculation was that in return for Nash the Blue Jackets would ask for a top six forward, a top prospect and a first-round draft pick.\\nTrade speculation continued on into the summer with no deal imminent. While Howson claimed he merely wanted to receive \\\"market value\\\" in any deal for Nash, there was speculation that his asking price was too high for many rival NHL GMs to consider. Columbus eventually found a trade partner in the New York Rangers.
